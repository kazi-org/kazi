defmodule KaziWeb.Starmap.GoalSource do
  @moduledoc """
  The injectable read seam the starmap's wave-band goal-DAG layout renders
  from (T46.5, ADR-0057, extending ADR-0056's roadmap-DAG concept).

  The starmap's home view is a fleet-wide projection of the run registry; the
  wave-band layout ADDITIONALLY overlays that fleet onto a `needs`-DAG so
  runs render as topological BANDS (reusing `Kazi.Goal.DepGraph.frontiers/1`,
  the same computation `kazi apply --explain` prints) instead of a flat list.
  That DAG is:

    * the **ADR-0056 roadmap DAG** — a goal whose declared groups are the
      roadmap's goal-level `needs` edges — when a roadmap ref has been
      configured (`kazi plan --project`'s eventual output; not yet a
      first-class read-model object), or
    * **absent**, in which case the starmap falls back to "single-goal
      groups": a flat list of the currently registered runs with no declared
      ordering, exactly the walking-skeleton behavior T46.5's first slice
      shipped.

  This module is the ADR-0011 §3 injection point (mirroring
  `KaziWeb.DagSource`/`KaziWeb.CoordinationSource`): production defaults to
  `KaziWeb.Starmap.GoalSource.None` (no roadmap configured — always the flat
  fallback); a test points `Application.put_env(:kazi, :starmap_goal_source,
  ...)` at a fixture module returning a seeded `Kazi.Goal.t()` so the
  wave-band layout certifies with no scheduler, no CLI, and no goal-file on
  disk.
